<p class="lp">
Last week, I gave a talk about Go at the Boston Google Developers
Group meeting. There were some problems with the recording, so I
have rerecorded the talk as a screencast and posted it on YouTube.
</p>

<center>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytEkHepK08c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>

<p class="lp">
Here are the answers to questions asked at the end of the talk.
</p>

<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How does Go work with debuggers?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
To start, both Go toolchains include debugging information that gdb
can read in the final binaries, so basic gdb functionality works on Go
programs just as it does on C programs.
</p>
<p class="lp">
We&rsquo;ve talked for a while about a custom Go debugger, but there isn&rsquo;t
one yet.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Many of the programs we want to debug are live, running programs. The
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">net/http/pprof</a> package provides debugging information like goroutine
stacks, memory profiling, and cpu profiling in response to special
HTTP requests.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. If a goroutine is stuck reading from a channel with no other references, does the goroutine get garbage collected?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
No. From the garbage collection point of view, both sides of the
channel are represented by the same pointer, so it can&rsquo;t distinguish
the receive and send sides. Even if we could detect this situation,
we&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s very useful to keep these goroutines around,
because the program is probably heading for a deadlock. When a Go
program deadlocks, it prints all its goroutine stacks and then exits.
If we garbage collected the goroutines as they got stuck, the deadlock
handler wouldn&rsquo;t have anything useful to print except "your entire
program has been garbage collected".
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Can a C++ program call into Go?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
We wrote a tool called <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a> so that Go programs can call into C, and
we&rsquo;ve implemented support for Go in SWIG, so that Go programs can call
into C++. In those programs, the C or C++ can in turn call back into
Go. But we don&rsquo;t have support for a C or C++ program—one that starts
execution in the C or C++ world instead of the Go world—to call into
Go.
</p>
<p class="lp">
The hardest part of the cross-language calls is converting between the
C calling convention and the Go calling convention, specifically with
the regard to the implementation of segmented stacks. But that&rsquo;s been
done and works.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Making the assumption that these mixed-language binaries start in Go
has simplified a number of parts of the implementation. I don&rsquo;t
anticipate any technical surprises involved in removing these
assumptions. It&rsquo;s just work.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What are the areas that you specifically are trying to improve the language?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
For the most part, I&rsquo;m not trying to improve the language itself. Part
of the effort in preparing Go 1 was to identify what we wanted to
improve and do it. Many of the big changes were based on two or three
years of experience writing Go programs, and they were changes we&rsquo;d
been putting off because we knew that they&rsquo;d be disruptive. But now
that Go 1 is out, we want to stop changing things and spend another
few years using the language as it exists today. At this point we
don&rsquo;t have enough experience with Go 1 to know what really needs
improvement.
</p>
<p class="lp">
My Go work is a small amount of fixing bugs in the libraries or in the
compiler and a little bit more work trying to improve the performance
of what&rsquo;s already there.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What about talking to databases and web services?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
For databases, one of the packages we added in Go 1 is a standard
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/">database/sql</a> package. That package defines a standard API for
interacting with SQL databases, and then people can implement drivers
that connect the API to specific database implementations like SQLite
or MySQL or Postgres.
</p>
<p class="lp">
For web services, you&rsquo;ve seen the support for JSON and XML encodings.
Those are typically good enough for ad hoc REST services. I recently
wrote a <a href="http://go.pkgdoc.org/code.google.com/p/rsc/smugmug">package for connecting to the SmugMug photo hosting API</a>, and there&rsquo;s one
generic call that unmarshals the response into a struct of the
appropriate type, using <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal">json.Unmarshal</a>. I expect that XML-based web
services like SOAP could be framed this way too, but I&rsquo;m not aware of
anyone who&rsquo;s done that.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Inside Google, of course, we have plenty of services, but they&rsquo;re
based on protocol buffers, so of course there&rsquo;s a good
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/">protocol buffer library for Go</a>.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What about generics? How far off are they?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
People have asked us about generics from day 1. The answer has always
been, and still is, that it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought
into, but we haven&rsquo;t yet found an approach that we think is a good fit
for Go. We&rsquo;ve talked to people who have been involved in the design of
generics in other languages, and they&rsquo;ve almost universally cautioned
us not to rush into something unless we understand it very well and
are comfortable with the implications. We don&rsquo;t want to do something
that we&rsquo;ll be stuck with forever and regret.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Also, speaking for myself, I don&rsquo;t miss generics when I write Go
programs. What&rsquo;s there, having built-in support for arrays, slices,
and maps, seems to work very well.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Finally, we just made this promise about backwards compatibility with
the release of Go 1. If we did add some form of generics, my guess is
that some of the existing APIs would need to change, which can&rsquo;t
happen until Go 2, which I think is probably years away.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What types of projects does Google use Go for?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
Most of the things we use Go for I can&rsquo;t talk about. One notable
exception is that Go is an App Engine language, which we announced at
I/O last year. Another is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vitess/">vtocc</a>,
a MySQL load balancer used to manage database lookups in YouTube&rsquo;s core infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How does the Plan 9 toolchain differ from other compilers?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
It&rsquo;s a completely incompatible toolchain in every way. The main
difference is that object files don&rsquo;t contain machine code in the
sense of having the actual instruction bytes that will be used in the
final binary. Instead they contain a custom encoding of the assembly
listings, and the linker is in charge of turning those into actual
machine instructions. This means that the assembler, C compiler, and
Go compiler don&rsquo;t all duplicate this logic. The main change for Go is
the support for segmented stacks.
</p>
<p class="lp">
I should add that we love the fact that we have two completely
different compilers, because it keeps us honest about really
implementing the spec.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What are segmented stacks?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
One of the problems in threaded C programs is deciding how big a stack
each thread should have. If the stack is too small, then the thread
might run out of stack and cause a crash or silent memory corruption,
and if the stack is too big, then you&rsquo;re wasting memory. In Go, each
goroutine starts with a small stack, typically 4 kB, and then each
function checks if it is about to run out of stack and if so allocates
a new stack segment that gets recycled once it&rsquo;s not needed anymore.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Gccgo supports segmented stacks, but it requires support added
recently to the new GNU linker, gold, and that support is only
implemented for x86-32 and x86-64.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Segmented stacks are something that lots of people have done before in
experimental or research systems, but they have never made it into the
C toolchains.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What is the overhead of segmented stacks?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
It&rsquo;s a few instructions per function call. It&rsquo;s been a long time since
I tried to measure the precise overhead, but in most programs I expect
it to be not more than 1-2%. There are definitely things we could do
to try to reduce that, but it hasn&rsquo;t been a concern.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Do goroutine stacks adapt in size?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
The initial stack allocated for a goroutine does not adapt. It&rsquo;s
always 4k right now. It has been other values in the past but always a
constant. One of the things I&rsquo;d like to do is to look at what the
goroutine will be running and adjust the stack accordingly, but I
haven&rsquo;t.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Are there any short-term plans for dynamic loading of modules?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
No. I don&rsquo;t think there are any technical surprises, but assuming that
everything is statically linked simplified some of the implementation.
Like with calling Go from C++ programs, I believe it&rsquo;s just work.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Gccgo might be closer to support for this, but I don&rsquo;t believe that it
supports dynamic loading right now either.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How much does the language spec say about reflection?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
The spec is intentionally vague about reflection, but <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/">package
reflect&rsquo;s API</a> is definitely part of the Go 1 definition. Any
conforming implementation would need to implement that API. In fact,
gc and gccgo do have different implementations of that package reflect
API, but then the packages that use reflect like <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/fmt/">fmt</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/">json</a> can be
shared.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Do you have a release schedule?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
We don&rsquo;t have any fixed release schedule. We&rsquo;re not keeping things
secret, but we&rsquo;re also not making commitments to specific timelines.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Go 1 was in progress publicly for months, and if you watched you could
see the bug count go down and the release candidates announced, and so
on.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Right now we&rsquo;re trying to slow down. We want people to write things
using Go, which means we need to make it a stable foundation to build
on. Go 1.0.1, the first bug release, was released four weeks after Go
1, and Go 1.0.2 was seven weeks after Go 1.0.1.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Where do you see Go in five years? What languages will it replace?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
I hope that it will still be at golang.org, that the Go project will
still be thriving and relevant. We built it to write the kinds of
programs we&rsquo;ve been writing in C++, Java, and Python, but we&rsquo;re not
trying to go head-to-head with those languages. Each of those has
definite strengths that make them the right choice for certain
situations. We think that there are plenty of situations, though,
where Go is a better choice.
</p>
<p class="lp">
If Go doesn&rsquo;t work out, and for some reason in five years we&rsquo;re
programming in something else, I hope the something else would have
the features I talked about, specifically the Go way of doing
interfaces and the Go way of handling concurrency.
</p>
<p class="lp">
If Go fails but some other language with those two features has taken
over the programming landscape, if we can move the computing world to
a language with those two features, then I&rsquo;d be sad about Go but happy
to have gotten to that situation.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What are the limits to scalability with building a system with many goroutines?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
The primary limit is the memory for the goroutines. Each goroutine
starts with a 4kB stack and a little more per-goroutine data, so the
overhead is between 4kB and 5kB. That means on this laptop I can
easily run 100,000 goroutines, in 500 MB of memory, but a million
goroutines is probably too much.
</p>
<p class="lp">
For a lot of simple goroutines, the 4 kB stack is probably more than
necessary. If we worked on getting that down we might be able to
handle even more goroutines. But remember that this is in contrast to
C threads, where 64 kB is a tiny stack and 1-4MB is more common.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How would you build a traditional barrier using channels?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
It&rsquo;s important to note that channels don&rsquo;t attempt to be a concurrency
Swiss army knife. Sometimes you do need other concepts, and the
standard <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/sync/">sync</a> package has some helpers. I&rsquo;d probably use a
<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">sync.WaitGroup</a>.
</p>
<p class="lp">
If I had to use channels, I would do it like in the web crawler
example, with a channel that all the goroutines write to, and a
coordinator that knows how many responses it expects.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What is an example of the kind of application you&rsquo;re working on performance for? How will you beat C++?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
I haven&rsquo;t been focusing on specific applications. Go is still young
enough that if you run some microbenchmarks you can usually find
something to optimize. For example, I just sped up floating point
computation by about 25% a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;m also working on more
sophisticated analyses for things like escape analysis and bounds
check elimination, which address problems that are unique to Go, or at
least not problems that C++ faces.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Our goal is definitely not to beat C++ on performance. The goal for Go
is to be near C++ in terms of performance but at the same time be a
much more productive environment and language, so that you&rsquo;d rather
program in Go.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What are the security features of Go?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
Go is a type-safe and memory-safe language. There are no dangling
pointers, no pointer arithmetic, no use-after-free errors, and so on.
</p>
<p class="lp">
You can break the rules by importing package <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/unsafe/">unsafe</a>, which gives
you a special type unsafe.Pointer. You can convert any pointer or
integer to an unsafe.Pointer and back. That&rsquo;s the escape hatch, which
you need sometimes, like for extracting the bits of a float64 as a
uint64. But putting it in its own package means that unsafe code is
explicitly marked as unsafe. If your program breaks in a strange way,
you know where to look.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Isolating this power also means that you can restrict it. On App
Engine you can&rsquo;t import package unsafe in the code you upload for your
app.
</p>
<p class="lp">
I should point out that the current Go implementation does have
<a href="http://research.swtch.com/gorace">data races</a>, but they are not
fundamental to the language. It would be possible to eliminate the
races at some cost in efficiency, and for now we&rsquo;ve decided not to do
that. There are also tools such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/wiki/ThreadSanitizerGo">Thread Sanitizer</a> that help find these kinds of data races in Go
programs.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What language do you think Go is trying to displace?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
I don&rsquo;t think of Go that way. We were writing C++ code before we did
Go, so we definitely wanted not to write C++ code anymore. But we&rsquo;re
not trying to displace all C++ code, or all Python code, or all Java
code, except maybe in our own day-to-day work.
</p>
<p class="lp">
One of the surprises for me has been the variety of languages that new
Go programmers used to use. When we launched, we were trying to
explain Go to C++ programmers, but many of the programmers Go has
attracted have come from more dynamic languages like Python or Ruby.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How does Go make it possible to use multiple cores?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
Go lets you tell the runtime how many operating system threads to use
for executing goroutines, and then it muxes the goroutines onto those
threads. So if you&rsquo;ve written a program that has four or more
goroutines executing simultaneously, you can tell the runtime to use
four OS threads and then you&rsquo;re running on four cores.
</p>
<p class="lp">
We&rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised by how easy people find it to write
these kinds of programs. People who have not written parallel or
concurrent programs before write concurrent Go programs using channels
that can take advantage of multiple cores, and they enjoy the
experience. That&rsquo;s more than you can usually say for C threads. Joe
Armstrong, one of the creators of Erlang, makes the point that
thinking about concurrency in terms of communication might be more
natural for people, since communication is something we&rsquo;ve done for a
long time. I agree.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How does the muxing of goroutines work?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
It&rsquo;s not very smart. It&rsquo;s the simplest thing that isn&rsquo;t completely
stupid: all the scheduling operations are O(1), and so on, but there&rsquo;s
a shared run queue that the various threads pull from. There&rsquo;s no
affinity between goroutines and threads, there&rsquo;s no attempt to make
sophisticated scheduling decisions, and there&rsquo;s not even preemption.
</p>
<p class="lp">
The goroutine scheduler was the first thing I wrote when I started
working on Go, even before I was working full time on it, so it&rsquo;s just
about four years old. It has served us surprisingly well, but we&rsquo;ll
probably want to replace it in the next year or so. We&rsquo;ve been having
some discussions recently about what we&rsquo;d want to try in a new
scheduler.

<p class="lp">
<b>Q. Is there any plan to bootstrap Go in Go, to write the Go compiler in Go?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
There&rsquo;s no immediate plan. Go does ship with a Go program parser
written in Go, so the first piece is already done, and there&rsquo;s an
experimental type checker in the works, but those are mainly for
writing program analysis tools. I think that Go would be a great
language to write a compiler in, but there&rsquo;s no immediate plan. The
current compiler, written in C, works well.
</p>
<p class="lp">
I&rsquo;ve worked on bootstrapped languages in the past, and I found that
bootstrapping is not necessarily a good fit for languages that are
changing frequently. It reminded me of climbing a cliff and screwing
hooks into the cliff once in a while to catch you if you fall. Once or
twice I got into situations where I had identified a bug in the
compiler, but then trying to write the code to fix the bug tickled the
bug, so it couldn&rsquo;t be compiled. And then you have to think hard about
how to write the fix in a way that avoids the bug, or else go back
through your version control history to find a way to replay history
without introducing the bug. It&rsquo;s not fun.
</p>
<p class="lp">
The fact that Go wasn&rsquo;t written in itself also made it much easier to
make significant language changes. Before the initial release we went
through a handful of wholesale syntax upheavals, and I&rsquo;m glad we
didn&rsquo;t have to worry about how we were going to rebootstrap the
compiler or ensure some kind of backwards compatibility during those
changes.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Finally, I hope you&rsquo;ve read Ken Thompson&rsquo;s Turing Award lecture, <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html">Reflections on Trusting Trust</a>. When we were planning the initial open
source release, we liked to joke that no one in their right mind would
accept a bootstrapped compiler binary written by Ken.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What does Go do to compile efficiently at scale?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
This is something that we talked about a lot in early talks about Go.
The main thing is that it cuts off transitive dependencies when
compiling a single module. In most languages, if package A imports B,
and package B imports C, then the compilation of A reads not just the
compiled form of B but also the compiled form of C. In large systems,
this gets out of hand quickly. For example, in C++ on my Mac,
including &lt;iostream&gt; reads 25,326 lines from 131 files. 
(C and C++ headers aren't &ldquo;compiled form,&rdquo; but the problem is the same.)
Go promises that each import reads a single compiled package file. If you
need to know something about other packages to understand that
package&rsquo;s API, then the compiled file includes the extra information
you need, but only that.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Of course, if you are building from scratch and package A imports B
which imports C, then of course C has to be compiled first, and then
B, and then A. The import point is that when you go to compile A, you
don&rsquo;t reload C&rsquo;s object file. In a real program, the dependencies are
usually not a chain like this. We might have A1, A2, A3, and so on all
importing B. It&rsquo;s a significant win if none of them need to reread C.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. How do you identify a good project for Go?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
I think a good project for Go is one that you&rsquo;re excited about writing
in Go. Go really is a general purpose programming language, and except
for the compiler work, it&rsquo;s the only language I&rsquo;ve written significant
programs in for the past four years.
</p>
<p class="lp">
Most of the people I know who are using Go are using it for networked
servers, where the concurrency features have something contribute, but
it&rsquo;s great for other contexts too. I&rsquo;ve used it to write a simple mail
reader, file system implementations to read old disks, and a variety
of other unnetworked programs.
</p>
<p class="lp">
<b>Q. What is the current and future IDE support for Go?</b>
</p>
<p class="lp">
I&rsquo;m not an IDE user in the modern sense, so really I don&rsquo;t know. We
think that it would be possible to write a really nice IDE
specifically for Go, but it&rsquo;s not something we&rsquo;ve had time to explore.
The Go distribution has a <a href="http://golang.org/misc">misc</a> directory that
contains basic Go support for common editors, and there is a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/goclipse">Goclipse project</a> to write an
Eclipse-based IDE, but I don&rsquo;t know much about those.
</p>
<p class="lp">
The development environment I use,
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.pdf">acme</a>, is great for
writing Go code, but not because of any custom Go support.
